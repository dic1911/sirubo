      ASN prefix (big tech conglomerate) outbound traffic blocker.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYNOPSIS
========

sirubo [argument]

  create    Generate new firewall ruleset and login service.
  list      Display existing firewall ruleset.
  resume    Resume enforcement of existing firewall ruleset and enable
            login service.
  stop      Disable existing firewall ruleset and login service.


DESCRIPTION
===========

The sirubo utility is a POSIX shell script that makes use of:

  - nftables on Linux and pf on OpenBSD, to facilitate the rejection of
    outgoing traffic to prefixes (subnets) associated with autonomous
    system networks (ASNs) that you, the user, specify.

  - whois, to perform a query for ASN prefixes (subnets).


MOTIVE
======

Preventing passive and nonconsensual telemetry, and the infringement of
one's privacy thereafter, from impertinently inquisitive big tech
conglomerates, such as Facebook and Alphabet (Google).


NAME ORIGIN
===========

Dissecting the etymology of sirubo (pronounced as seer-rue-bow), "si"
refers to the silicon chemical symbol (Si), which is in reference to
Silicon Valley. "rubo" is a word of the universal auxiliary language of
Esperanto, meaning "trash" or "garbage".


REQUIREMENTS
============

OpenBSD | Linux
------- | -----
pf      | nftables
whois   | whois
        | systemd


INSTALLING
==========

1) Install sirubo and create a configuration file:

% sudo make

2) To illustrate, add the following two lines of ASNs to
   "/usr/local/etc/sirubo.conf":

AS15169 # Facebook
AS32934 # Google

3) Generate a new firewall ruleset:

% sirubo create

   In addition, a login service will be created, enabling ruleset
   persistency and automatic ruleset updates upon system reboots.

4) Test your new firewall ruleset. Attempt to open a TCP connection with
   a domain name or IP address associated with a specified ASN:

% nc -vw 1 google.com 443

   Which should print output such as this:

> nc: connect to google.com (0.0.0.0) port 443 (tcp) failed: Connection
> refused

   This will indicate that your firewall is configured to reject
   outbound traffic to google.com.


UNINSTALLING
============

1) From its repository, run the following to uninstall sirubo:

% make uninstall

   Or run the following to uninstall sirubo and delete its
   configuration file:

% make clean
